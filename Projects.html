                            The Thales Arduino Competition was hosted by Thales from October 10th to October 31st, 2017.
                            I had applied earlier that year for the Thales Arduino Competition and was one of twenty four students
                            who were selected. All twenty fout students were split into 6 teams of four people. My group consisted of
                            two 4th year electrical engingeerg students, a computer science and me. <br/>

                            The Thales Competition had a few rules:
                            <ul>
                                <li>An Arduino must be used</li>
                                <li>The project had to be inspired by Thales</li>
                                <li>Use of other equipment was limited and need to be asked permission, e.g. Raspberry Pi</li>
                            </ul>

                            Thales
