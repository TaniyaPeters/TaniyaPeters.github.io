                        What is left for me? Anger? Is that what I have become? A fallen angel? 
                        <br/>I fought for the good and the pure,<br/> when did this happen? Why was I destroyed, why was I brought down like this?<br/> My name was herald by even the archangels and now I’m less <br/>than those worms I destroy. Is there anything else <br/>left for me? Must I join the devils? Must I commit a sin worse than death? Betraying those that I fought for? No, I can’t, for I’m not alone; my sister Auriel was <br/>sent with me. Auriel, the purest of angels, my dear sister. How has this come to be?<br/> What have I done? Is there anyone to reach our former glory?

Should we side with these<br/> so-called Heroes of the Storm for the time being? Should I find <br/>forgiveness helping those mortals<br/> I so pity? If this<br/> is the way I must go, I will, for my sister. <br/>If I can only find a way for her to return I will not waver <br/>and let her ascend. <br/>However, I fear even if I help her ascend our other siblings will not be to happy. Those that banished me, banished us. And for what? My love for the<br/> humans? Only my dear sister Auriel stood up for me. I will <br/>protect her with all that I am made of.

My love for the humans? Only my dea<br/>r sister Auriel stood up for me.<br/> I will protect her with all that I am made of.
